# We're using pelican and it's amazing.

This blog is hosted on my FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE VPS
and powered by pelican. 

Writing posts with pelican is pretty great:

- Write whatever you want in markdown with you favourite text editor (vim!)
- run `make html`
- run `make ssh_upload` which doesn't need a password since I use ssh keys!
- Boom, it's uploaded.

Oh and for anyone wondering, we're using the pelican-bootstrap3 theme!
