title: What to expect in NetBSD 7

NetBSD 7 is almost out and I though I'd share some of the stuff that the 200+ developpers have been working on. This fantastic operating system now works on more than 70 platforms and 39 architectures like x86, mips, arm, vax, ppc, sparc, sun2/3, atari, dreamcast, alpha, amiga, luna68k, acorn32, ...

## Graphics

Taylor Campbell (@riadstradh) has been working hard on getting DRM/KMS, the kernel graphics drivers from Linux 3.15 ready. It supports many cards like the Intel, up through Haswell and many Radeons. He also imported [Nouveau](http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/) code, which would make recent nVidia cards work; it compiles and links, but it is very much a work in progress.

NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/presentations/riastradh/asiabsdcon2015/drmkms-status.pdf), Taylor Campbell for AsiaBSDCon 2015.

## SoC

- NetBSD now supports multiprocessor ARM. The supported System On Chips devices are, but not limited to:

	- [Raspberry Pi](https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/evbarm/raspberry_pi/) and Raspberry Pi 2!
	- TI OMAP, Sitara: Beagleboard, Beaglebone, BB Black
	- Allwinner A10, A20, A31: Cubieboard, Cubietruck
	- Marvell Armada 370: Mirabox
	- Freescale i.MX50, i.MX51, i.MX6: KOBO, Netwalker
	- Xilinx Zynq: Parallela, ZEDBOARD
	- and more..

- The EABI (and OABI compat)
- Hard-float with VFP and NEON
- MIPS Creator CI20 reaches user land.[NetBSD blog entry](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/so_they_sent_me_a).

## The toolchain

- NetBSD supports GCC 4.8, including C++11
- llvm is also in the base, thanks to Joerg Sonnenberger (@joerg) but only amd64, i386, arm work well. PowerPC and MIPS are still a work in progress.
- PCC is also available, for m68k and vax.
- Fully BSD-licensed C/C++ runtime from compiler rt,
libc++, libcxxrt
- See the [EuroBSDCon 2014 presentation]((http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/presentations/joerg/eurobsdcon2014/#/)

## Security

- Introduction of the [reallocarr(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/reallocarr.3.html) function to aid memory reallocation for arrays.
- NetBSD also introduced a [reallocarray(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/reallocarray.3.html) function for OpenBSD code compatibility.
- See the [mailing lists discussion](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-userlevel/2015/02/05/msg008912.html) about why reallocarr was implemented rather than using OpenBSD's reallocarray.
- Constant-time comparison and guaranteed zeroing for crypto:
[consttime memequal(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/consttime_memequal.3.html), [explicit_memset(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/explicit_memset.3.html).
- RC4 is gone! arc4random now uses ChaCha20.

## Miscellaneous

- bpf just-in-time native code compiler [EuroBSDCon 2014 slides](http://wiki.netbsd.org/users/alnsn/EuroBSDCon2014-JIT-Code-Generator-for-NetBSD.pdf)
- Major improvements to [npf](http://www.netbsd.org/~rmind/npf/), the scalable NetBSD packet Filter, since its preliminary release in NetBSD 6
- Multiprocessor USB stack
- new port : epoc32

## Current work

The good stuff that probably won't make it to NetBSD 7:

- DTrace on by default in kernel
- Multiprocessor network stack
- nVidia graphics
- Newer Intel graphics from Linux 4.0: Broadwell, &c
- ARMv8 / AArch64 : 64-bit ARM.
