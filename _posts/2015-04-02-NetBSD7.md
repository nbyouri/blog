title: What to expect in NetBSD 7

NetBSD 7 is almost out and I thought I'd share some of the stuff that the 200+ developpers have been working on. This fantastic operating system now works on more than 70 platforms and 39 architectures like x86, mips, arm, vax, ppc, sparc, sun2/3, atari, dreamcast, alpha, amiga, luna68k, acorn32, ...

## Graphics

Taylor Campbell (@riadstradh) has been working hard on getting DRM/KMS, the kernel graphics drivers from Linux 3.15 ready. It supports many cards like the Intel, up through Haswell and many Radeons. He also imported [Nouveau](http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/) code, which would make recent nVidia cards work; it compiles and links, but it is very much a work in progress.

## SoC

- NetBSD now supports SMP for many ARM cores.
- Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi 2 (no SMP)! [NetBSD wiki entry](https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/evbarm/raspberry_pi/).
- TI OMAP, Sitara: Beagleboard, Beaglebone, BB Black
- Allwinner A10, A20, A31, A80(current): Cubieboard, Cubietruck, Hummingbird, Banana Pi
- Marvell Armada 370: Mirabox
- Freescale i.MX50, i.MX51, i.MX6: KOBO, Netwalker
- Xilinx Zynq: Parallela, ZEDBOARD
- Rockship : MINIX NEO X7, Radxa Rock 2013/Pro/Lite, Rayeager PX2
- For ARM, The EABI (and OABI compat), Hard-float with VFP and NEON
- MIPS Creator CI20 reaches user land. [NetBSD blog entry](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/so_they_sent_me_a).
- Hardkernel ODROID-C1. [NetBSD blog entry](http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_ported_to_hardkernel_odroid).
- and more, see the evbarm [kernel configs](http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/arch/evbarm/conf/).

## The toolchain

- NetBSD supports GCC 4.8, including C++11
- LLVM/Clang is also in the base, thanks to Jörg Sonnenberger (@joerg), amd64, i386, arm work well. PowerPC and MIPS are still a work in progress.
- PCC is also available, for m68k and vax.
- While the default runtime includes libgcc and libstdc++ from GCC for ABI compatibility, a fully BSD licensed RTL is available via build flags.
- See the [EuroBSDCon 2014 presentation](http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/presentations/joerg/eurobsdcon2014/#/)

## Security

- Introduction of the [reallocarr(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/reallocarr.3.html) function to aid memory reallocation for arrays.
- NetBSD also introduced a [reallocarray(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/reallocarray.3.html) function for OpenBSD code compatibility.
- See the [mailing lists discussion](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-userlevel/2015/02/05/msg008912.html) about why reallocarr was implemented rather than using OpenBSD's reallocarray.
- Constant-time comparison and guaranteed zeroing for crypto:
[consttime memequal(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/consttime_memequal.3.html), [explicit_memset(3)](http://www.daemon-systems.org/man/explicit_memset.3.html).
- RC4 is gone! arc4random now uses ChaCha20. [Taylor Campbell's slides about randomness in NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/presentations/riastradh/eurobsdcon2014/devrandom.pdf).
- OpenSSL updates, LibreSSL is available in pkgsrc wip, soon to be in pkgsrc.

## Miscellaneous

- bpf just-in-time native code compiler [EuroBSDCon 2014 slides](http://wiki.netbsd.org/users/alnsn/EuroBSDCon2014-JIT-Code-Generator-for-NetBSD.pdf)
- Major improvements to [npf](http://www.netbsd.org/~rmind/npf/), the scalable NetBSD packet Filter, since its preliminary release in NetBSD 6
- Multiprocessor USB stack
- new port : epoc32

## Current work

The good stuff that probably won't make it to NetBSD 7:

- Stable ZFS
- DTrace on by default in kernel
- Multiprocessor network stack
- nVidia graphics
- Newer Intel graphics from Linux 4.0: Broadwell, &c
- ARMv8 / AArch64 : 64-bit ARM.
- nVidia Jetson TK1
- risc-v
- OpenRISC
- and much more...
