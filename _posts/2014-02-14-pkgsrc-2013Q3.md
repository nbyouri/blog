My poor MacBook just finished compiling the 2013Q3 branch of pkgsrc, you can have a look at it [here](http://pkgsrc.saveosx.org/Darwin/2013Q3/x86_64/). I also updated the bootstrap archive; see the [download](http://saveosx.org/download-and-install) page for instructions.


Pkgin Stats:
------

        Remote package database(s):
                Number of repositories: 1
                Packages available: 7558
                Total size of packages: 6.97 GB


Build info:
-----------

The packages are compiled on Mac OS X 10.9.1 Mavericks and more specifically Darwin 13.0.2 for the x86_64 architecture.

Here's the mk.conf I used:
        
        # Example /usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf file produced by bootstrap-pkgsrc
        # Tue Oct 15 21:21:46 CEST 2013
        
        .ifdef BSD_PKG_MK               # begin pkgsrc settings

        .endif                          # end pkgsrc settings

Most of the packages are also signed using gpg, see [this](http://saveosx.org/signed-packages/) post about it.

More information:
-----------------

XQuartz is still needed to run the X programs but they are linked against pkgsrc's libraries. 

The compiler used is the clang shipped with Mac OS X:

        Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)
        Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.2
        Thread model: posix

The packages don't use the built-in libraries like ncurses, libiconv, zlib for more portability.
