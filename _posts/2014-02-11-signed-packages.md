title: Signed Packages

The pkgsrc 2013Q3 branch repo is almost finished compiling, it features all the ports fixes I've been working on, and now the ports use the X11 libs from inside pkgsrc so XQuartz will only be needed to actually start the X server! I will try to get an X server working from pkgsrc to avoid having to install XQuartz from macosforge! But more importantly, the packages are now signed! This means you can easily make sure the packages are coming from a trusted source (you trust me, right?)
