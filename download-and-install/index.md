Download and Install
====================

So you want to try it out, then? Great!
Before you get started: **you'll need root privileges on your system**

Want to be up and running fast?
-------------------------------
For a streamlined setup, to get you up and running in under a minute, there's the `quickstrap` script.  
To get started, grab a copy of our [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx) over on GitHub:

	$ git clone git://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx

Or, if you don't have `git` installed, just [grab the zip archive](https://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx/archive/master.zip).
	   
Open up a Terminal (this must be Apple's 'Terminal.app'), then `cd` to the `scripts` sub-directory and run the `quickstrap` script.  
If you'd prefer an interactive install, run the `bootstrap` script, which also includes the set up of [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/) and some work we've done to make it a seamless X11 experience.

Want to read more about the install? See [the 'Install' section of the README](https://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx#installation)!
