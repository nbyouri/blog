Download and Install
====================

So you want to try it out, then? Great!
Before you get started: **you'll need root privileges on your system**

To get you up and running in under a minute, grab a copy of our [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx) over on GitHub:

	$ git clone git://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx.git

Or, if you don't have `git` installed, just [grab the zip archive](https://github.com/cmacrae/saveosx/archive/master.zip).
	   
Open up a terminal, `cd` to wherever you placed the repo, and simply run the `bootstrap` script: `./bootstrap`
