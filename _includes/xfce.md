## pkgsrc xfce4 upgrade proposal

Right now, pkgsrc has xfce4.6, which is 6 years old and 3 stable releases late,
I am working on updating our old xfce to the newly released 4.12.

I would like to update our ports as follows:


port  | description 
------|-----------
audio/xfce4-mixer | updated from 4.6.1nb21 to 4.11.0
audio/xfce4-xmms-plugin | updated from 0.5.1 to 0.5.3
devel/xfce4-dev-tools | updated from 4.6.0 to 4.12.0
