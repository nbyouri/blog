#####What makes it different from Homebrew and MacPorts ?
We distribute binary packages, so; no compilation is necessary. This means you can install packages and 
their dependencies much faster!
pkgsrc is cross-platform, which means the package you're going to install with
saveosx will also be available in the same way for SmartOS, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, ...
